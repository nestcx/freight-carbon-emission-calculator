# Cargo2 - The Australian Carbon Freight Calculator


<br>

## What is it?

Cargo2 is a web tool that lets you create, manage, and analyse road freight shipments. You tell it where your shipment begins and ends, how much load weight you are sending, and the volume of your shipment, and it will tell you the greenhouse gas impact of your shipment.

## Who is it for?

This educational tool is for anyone who wants to learn the environmental impact of their road freight shipments.
